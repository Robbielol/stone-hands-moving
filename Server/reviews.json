They provided high-quality, stress-free, safe and no hassle moving of my upright piano, and spent time covering and protecting my instrument. I really appreciate their help and recommend them to anyone moving pianos or luxury items!",

My table was wrapped well to ensure it was protected, and they were very careful not to ding my walls. Communication was super quick. they even managed to accommodate my move the very next day! I would 100% recommend them for anyone looking for professional, reliable, and friendly movers. 10/10 service!! Thanks guys :)",

I also rescheduled our move a couple of times and Nigel was very patient accommodating all of my changes and really made the whole process very easy. Thanks for everything, Nigel!",

      "text": "I had a piano move with a sofa with Stonehand Moving Company in July.\nIt was some challenges for it. First of all,  I had two different pick up places from Richmond to Vancouver, Vancouver to Langley. They accepted and made it.\nAlso, the piano delivery was risk and difficult in the place. However the owner took care of it with his prompt strategy.\nThey serve the customer's needs with integrity, care for the piano and the environment. The cost is not expensive..\nI am grateful that I could have a service from this company. They are very friendly and kind.\nThank you very much, Nigel and Aaron !\nNow I am enjoying to play my piano at the new place.",
